# OdinRockPaperScissors

## Introduction
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game in JavaScript. It was created as a part of The Odin Project.

## Concepts Learned
While constructing this project, I used the following concepts:

1. **DOM Manipulation**: Used `document.getElementById` and `addEventListener` to handle user clicks on the buttons.

2. **Event Handling**: Used event listeners to capture user interactions and initiate game actions.

3. **Conditional Statements**: Employed `if-else` statements to determine the game's outcome based on user and computer choices.

4. **Functions**: Utilized functions to simplify code and manage different aspects of the game, such as generating the computer's choice and determining the winner of a round.

5. **Looping**: Implemented loops to play the game until a certain condition (a player reaches a score of 5).

6. **Scope**: Learned about variable scope, including local and global scope, to manage and update game scores.

7. **Random Number Generation**: Used `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` to generate a random computer choice.

8. **String Manipulation**: Performed string operations to display game results and messages to the user.
